# Processing and Visualizing Land Use Model Scenarios

This project was completed as a part of my Masters in Information Management at the University of Maryland, College Park. 

I worked with The National Center for Smart Growth Research and Education, which is a non-partisan center for research and education on smart growth in Maryland, in metropolitan regions round the nation, and around the world. The Centerâ€™s independent, objective, interdisciplinary research uses the diverse resources of the University of Maryland and a network of national experts to explore issues related to land use and the environment, transportation and public health, housing and community development, and international urban development.

Python libraries used: Tkinter, Matplotlib, Pandas, Seaborn, Numpy, Bokeh
